Project Name: Online Examination System

Project Description: This project involved creating an online exam system that allows an administrator to administer tests to students who are currently logged in to the system.

The exam category, subject, exam, and exam question can all be added, updated, and deleted here by the admin. Each thing is connected to the others. Consequently, if the exam is deleted by the admin, all of the questions associated with it will also be deleted. The system's admin can view all results as well as individual student results and student lists. The adminÂ can change the password, add an admin, and other things.

There is no need to authenticate while using the student module to display the exam category and subject, which immediately filters the exam under this. He or she must be logged in in order to give the. A user must register their name, email, and password in order to login. He or she is still permitted to use the registered email. A user can view his or her results, grades, and other information by logging in.

This web application is totally responsive.

As a survey form was forwarded to these colleges, a number of possible clients for this application include Islington, Herald, IIMS, MIS, ACE, and Softwarica.
